## Biography 
 I am currently a first year PhD student of [Centre for Robotics and AI]((https://www.robotics.manchester.ac.uk/)), the University of Manchester (UoM), and I am also a Doctoral Candidates of the EU Marie Sklodowska-Curie Action (MSCA) Doctoral Network (DN) [MSCA-DN](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/doctoral-networks), [RAICAM](www.raicam.eu). My research interests include robotics, whole body control, motion planning and mechanical and electronic design.

I am under the supervision of Dr. [Simon Watson](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/simon.watson) and Dr. [Bruno Adorno](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/Bruno.Adorno/default.htm). 

I recevied my bachelor's and master's degree from Chongqing University(CQU) in 2020 and Univeristy of Chinese Academy of Sciences(UCAS) in 2023, both in Control Science and Engineering.

## Robots 
My story with robot started from a global competition [Robomaster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2FR5xpIVeo). 
We formed teams according to the competition rules and completed task assignments. Team members designed mechanical structures, hardware circuits, and software algorithms.
The following pictures are my design during 2016-2018.

Then, from 2019 to 2022, I served as the team's advisor, guiding subsequent students to complete a series of excellent projects.

## Research
From 2020-2023, I served as a master student of UCAS and also an engineer in [SIAT-robot](https://english.siat.ac.cn/SI2017/IAIT2017/RC1/CIB/). 
My work included designing the autonomous driving control system and learning from demonstration for robotic arm.
